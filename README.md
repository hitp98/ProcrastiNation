ProcrastiNation is a Chrome extension that curbs procrastination through the power of money. Enjoy increased productivity while also supporting the charities of your choice!

How it works: Start a study session with ProcrastiNation, and ProcrastiNation will start monitoring your activity to make sure you aren't goofing off. It can tell whether you're on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or some other social media website, and will quickly let you know that you're not allowed to be on that site! If you choose to ignore it, however, ProcrastiNation won't forcibly block you off; instead, it will use your Ethereum Blockchain Wallet to donate money to the charity of your choice for every minute that you spend on social media.
